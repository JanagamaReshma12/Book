            <h3>Happy Halloween</h3>
            <img src="h1.jpg" alt="rt" style="width:100px">
            <p>Happy Halloween! A few years ago, we celebrated Frankenstein's 200th birthday by dedicating our summer reader poll to horror stories. We got more than 7,000 nominations and winnowed them down to a list of 100 spine-tingling titles. (Of course, lots has been published since then. After you get through these 100 you can check out this list of 13 new chilling and thrilling tales.) Enjoy!
