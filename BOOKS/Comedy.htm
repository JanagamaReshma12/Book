            <h3>Friend</h3>
            <p>A friend in a person
                to laugh and cry with,
                An inspiration,

                last forever.
                A friend is not a shadow nor a servant
                But someone who hold
                a piece of a person in his heart.
                Someone who shares a smile,
                Someone who brightens up your day
                What makes a person a friend?
                Is by saying your Love will stay.

            <p>
                Make new friends, but keep the old;
                Those are silver, these are gold.
                New-made friendships, like new wine,
                Age will mellow and refine.
                Friendships that have stood the test-
                Time and change- are surely best;
                Brow may wrinkle, hair grow gray;
                Friendship never knows decay.
                For ‘mid old friends, tried and true,
                Once more, we, our youth, renew.
                But old friends, alas! May die;
                New friends must their place supply.
                Cherish friendship in your breast-
                New is good, but old is best;
                Make new friends, but keep the old;
                Those are silver, these are gold.</p>
